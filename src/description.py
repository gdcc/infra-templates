The infra templates project is intended to provide you with valid Terraform files - powered by Jinja2.
This allows you to:

- Create validated Terraform files, based on your template, for infrastructure.
- Host them inside your Docker container. This is persistent storage.
- Connect these templates with bash scripts, cloudinit files, so that you can set them resources up as you want.

The engine is relatively lightweight, intended for full flexibility, and can be hosted on any infrastructure.
